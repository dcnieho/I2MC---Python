# I2MC---Python
I2MC implementation in Python (Tested on version 3.6)


For the original Matlab implementation see: https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC



For reference to the paper see: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0822-1


Due to slight differences in the implementation there might be some differences when compared to the Matlab version





From https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC:


The I2MC algorithm was designed to accomplish fixation classification in data across a wide range of noise levels and when periods of data loss may occur.
